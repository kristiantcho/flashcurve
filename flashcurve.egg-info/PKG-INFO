# *flashcurve*
## A machine-learning approach for the fast generation of adaptive-binning for lightcurves with Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data

### Notes
*flashcurve* is a python tool which can be setup on linux/macOS with python version >= 3.7

It should mostly be used to create adaptive time bins with constant significance (TS), but can also be used make images of data within time bins (see *flashcurve* paper).

*flashcurve* requires tensorflow-lite runtime to be installed seperately. This can be done via
```
pip install --extra-index-url https://google-coral.github.io/py-repo/ tflite_runtime
```

If you already have tensorflow installed, then you can just simply comment out `import tflite_runtime.interpreter as tflite` in `data_tools.py` and `image_tools` and uncomment `import tensorflow.lite as tflite` before installation.

Installation of *flashcurve* is done via
```
pip install -e <path to flashcurve>/flashcurve
```

Additionally, this repo contains a `fermi_tools.py` script with methods which require the fermipy package. Using this script is optional for creating lightcurves with the generated time bins. For information on how to install and use fermipy go to the [Fermipy wiki](https://fermipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Usage

Check the `lc_search.py` script for a detailed example of usage. A jupyter notebook with an example of generating a standalone image and printing the image will be uploaded soon.
